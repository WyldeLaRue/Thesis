\section{Character Table of the Dihedral Group}


The \emph{dihedral group} of order $2n$ is given by
\[
    D_{2n} := \langle a,b \mid a^n = b^2 = 1,\ bab = a^{-1} \rangle
\]
It occurs naturally as the planar symmetries of the $n$-gon. For this reason, elements of the form $a^i$ are often 
referred to as rotations and elements of the form $a^ib$ are referred to as reflections.


\subsection{Conjugacy Classes of $D_{2n}$}

Another writeup of this can be found in chapter 12 of \cite{James&Liebeck}
The conjugacy classes will be slightly different if $n$ is even or odd. We first give the case for $n$ even. 

Suppose $n = 2k$ (we are considering the Dihedral group of order $4k$)

The center of $D_8$ is given by
\[
    \mathbf{Z}(D_8) = \{1, a^\}
\]

Thus $[1]$ and $[a^k]$ are both of size 1.


Let $a^i$ be a rotation. Then $ba^ib^{-1} = a^{-1}$



\subsection{Irreducible Characters of $D_8$}

Again, this will be different depending on whether $n$ is even or odd. 

First we give the even case, for $D_{4k}$.

\subsubsection{Linear Characters}
The linear characters are the homomorphisms $\chi : D_8 \rightarrow \C^\times$. Since any group homomorphism is 
determined by its action on the generators, this is routine to check. Since $b^2 = 1$, we must have $\varphi(b)^2 = 
1$. Hence $\varphi(b) = 1$ or $\varphi(b) = -1$ 

Similarly, $\varphi(a) = \pm 1$ \TODO{Expand this}



The linear characters are precisely the homomorphisms $\lambda : D_{2n} \rightarrow \C^\times$. We can compute all 
such homomorphisms by looking at how they act on the generators. 

Let $\lambda : D_{2n} \rightarrow \C^\times$ be a homomorphism. Since $b^2 = 1$ we must have $\lambda(b)^2 = 1$, 
hence the only possible values for $\lambda(b)$ are $1$ and $-1$. Since we have the relation $abab = 1$, then $1 = 
\lambda(abab) = \lambda(a)\lambda(b)\lambda(a)\lambda(b) = \lambda(a)^2$. Thus $\lambda(a)$ must also be either $1$ 
or $-1$.


The degree 2 irreducible representations of $D_{2n}$ are $\rho_j$ given by
\[
    a \mapsto \rmat{\zeta_n^j}{0}{0}{\zeta_n^{-j}}, \quad \ \ b \mapsto \rmat{0}{1}{1}{0}
\]
and thus the irreducible characters of degree 2 are given by
\begin{align*}
    &\chi_j(a^i) = \zeta_n^j + \zeta_n^{-j} \\
    &\chi_j(a^ib) = 0
\end{align*}

\TODO{Finish this}


\section{Quantum Base Size of the Dihedral Group}

Here we compute the quantum base size for the standard action of the Dihedral group of order $2n$ on the vertices 
of the $n$-gon.

Let $G = D_{4k}$
