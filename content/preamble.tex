    %\chapter*{List of Abbreviations}
		%You can always change the way your abbreviations are formatted. Play around with it yourself, use tables, or come to CUS if you'd like to change the way it looks. You can also completely remove this chapter if you have no need for a list of abbreviations. Here is an example of what this could look like:

	%\begin{table}[h]
	%\centering % You could remove this to move table to the left
	%\begin{tabular}{ll}
		%\textbf{ABC}  	&  American Broadcasting Company \\
		%\textbf{CBS}  	&  Columbia Broadcasting System\\
		%\textbf{CDC}  	&  Center for Disease Control \\
		%\textbf{CIA}  	&  Central Intelligence Agency\\
		%\textbf{CLBR} 	&  Center for Life Beyond Reed\\
		%\textbf{CUS}  	&  Computer User Services\\
		%\textbf{FBI}  	&  Federal Bureau of Investigation\\
		%\textbf{NBC}  	&  National Broadcasting Corporation\\
	%\end{tabular}
	%\end{table}

    \chapter*{Abstract}
    In this thesis we study the query complexity of quantum oracle problems in which a learner must identify a 
    hidden group element by querying its action on a set. A recent paper of Pommersheim and Copeland connects this 
    problem to a classical problem in the representation theory of finite groups. We extend their work by computing 
    the query complexity for symmetric oracle problems associated to the dihedral groups and $GL(2,q)$.
